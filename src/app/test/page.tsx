            My salaryman days began in advertising. A discipline that taught me the value of narrative precision, the power of productive tension, and a religious belief that there&apos;s always space for tongues in cheeks.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            This mindset became my OS and has informed every subsequent endeavor: from framing consumer mindsets and articulating the future of industries, to branding personal experiments and performing improv on stage.
