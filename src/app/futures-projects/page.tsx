            Foresight isn&apos;t about prediction. It&apos;s about helping teams ask sharper questions, not just about what might shift, but what role they want to play if it does.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Every strategy today is built on an implicit story about who we are, what matters, and how the world works. I help teams surface these assumptions, challenge them, and explore alternative narratives that might better serve emerging realities.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            We begin by looking inward, clarifying the identity, values, and tensions already in play. Whether you&apos;re exploring what&apos;s next for your industry, your brand, or your culture, this is where we start.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Then, through scenario planning, speculative storytelling, and participatory workshops, we stretch perspective from &ldquo;what is&rdquo; to &ldquo;what if.&rdquo; To make this actionable, I often prototype &ldquo;today versions&rdquo; of future concepts, scrappy experiments that test new directions, right now.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            This work is as much about mindset as it is method, expanding what feels possible, so you can act with more clarity, conviction, and creativity.
